# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prince!

A curious engineer who enjoys building things that live in the cloud and behave nicely in production (most of the time 😄).  
I mix **cloud engineering**, **backend dev**, and **machine learning** to create practical, real-world solutions.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
- Learning all the cool cloud computing stuff on GCP ☁️  
- Breaking things with Terraform… then fixing them 💥➡️🛠️  
- Building ML models that *hopefully* help people  
- Designing clean UIs and solid backends  

## 🏗️ Some Cool Projects
- 🌾 **AI Crop Monitoring** – ML meets agriculture  
- 🛒 **E-commerce Backend** – Auth, APIs, and all that fun stuff  
- 🏭 **Warehouse Management System UI** – Angular + real industry workflows  
- 📊 **Customer Behavior Analysis** – Insights from real data  

## 🧰 My Toolbox
Python • JavaScript • TypeScript • Node.js • Express • Angular  
AWS • Docker • Terraform • Linux  
Pandas • NumPy • Scikit-learn  
Git • REST APIs  

## 🎯 Current Mission
Become a cloud/DevOps engineer who writes clean code, automates everything, and keeps systems running smoothly.

## ☕ Little About Me
Marathon runner 🏃‍♂️ • Football coach ⚽ • Coffee addict ☕  
(Surviving on caffeine since I discovered Vietnam.)
